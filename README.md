# Funfit: Comprehensive Backend Development Project

Welcome to the Funfit project repository! This project is designed to demonstrate and enhance backend development skills using Java Enterprise technologies. Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in building a backend system for managing gym participants and batches effectively.

## Project Overview

The Funfit project focuses on developing a backend solution for managing gym sessions, specifically Zumba classes, organized by Yamin, a gym instructor. The software solution aims to simplify the management of participants and batches, ensuring efficient session handling and participant tracking.

## Objectives

- **Backend Planning and Development**: Develop a robust backend using Java Enterprise technologies.
- **Database Connectivity**: Establish and manage connections between Java code and both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **Project Configuration**: Use Maven for build and dependency management to streamline project development.
- **Hands-on Experience**: Gain practical experience in designing server-side structures and implementing CRUD operations.

## PreRequisites

To work on this project, you should be familiar with the following technologies:

- Java
- Servlets
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Maven
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL

## Features

- **Participant Management**: Add, update, and delete participant information.
- **Batch Management**: Handle multiple Zumba batches efficiently.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using JDBC.
- **Dynamic Web Interface**: Interactive HTML and JSP pages for user interaction.
- **DAO Design Pattern**: Implement a structured approach to database interactions.

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language for backend development.
- **Servlets & JSP**: For building dynamic web content.
- **Maven**: For project build and dependency management.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing participant and batch information.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/funfit.git](https://github.com/Kaushikwagh/Simplilearn_FSD-Backend.git
   ```
   
2. **Open in Eclipse**:
   - Import the project as a Maven project in Eclipse.

3. **Configure Database**:
   - Set up a MySQL database and update the JDBC configuration in the project.

4. **Build the Project**:
   - Use Maven to build the project:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     ```

5. **Deploy on Tomcat**:
   - Deploy the project on an Apache Tomcat server.

## Usage

Once deployed, you can access the application via a web browser. Use the navigation menu to manage participants and batches. The application provides an intuitive interface for performing CRUD operations.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains Java classes and servlets.
- **src/main/webapp**: Includes JSP and HTML files.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file for project build.

## Development

### Key Steps

- **Implement Servlets**: Develop servlets for handling HTTP requests.
- **Design JSP Pages**: Create interactive pages for user actions.
- **Database Integration**: Use JDBC for database interactions.
- **Test and Validate**: Ensure all features work as intended before deployment.
